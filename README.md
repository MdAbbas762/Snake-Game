# Snake-Game

This repository contains the source code for a classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project serves as a basic-level mini project developed for practice and learning purposes.<br>
<br>
Overview<br>
The game allows the player to control a snake using arrow keys. The objective is to eat food items that appear randomly on the grid, which increases the snakeâ€™s length and score. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or with the game boundaries. After a game over, users are prompted to restart the game.<br>
<br>
Key Concepts Implemented<br>
Game loop: Managed using requestAnimationFrame to ensure smooth rendering.<br>
Snake movement: Controlled via keyboard input and updated using direction vectors.<br>
Collision detection: Checks for self-collision and boundary hits.<br>
Dynamic DOM manipulation: Snake and food elements are generated and updated on the grid using JavaScript.<br>
Score tracking: Score is updated in real-time as the snake eats food.<br>
Audio integration: Sound effects for movement, eating, and game over.<br>
